- **What it is?** ðŸ’¡
  To generate insights about Life Expectancy, we created a complete data pipeline â€” from ETL to a data warehouse â€” using APIs from the World Bank, World Health Organization, and United Nations. With this clean dataset, we built insightful dashboards and machine learning models for prediction.
