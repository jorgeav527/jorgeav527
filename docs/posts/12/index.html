<p>In computing, a <strong>client</strong> can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A <strong>server</strong> can be services, such as a remote system (hardware or software) that processes requests and returns responses like (AWS EC2, Google Cloud).</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Cloud-Based</summary>
  <p>Run, migrate, or build applications in the cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use case: <em>An application built with virtual servers, databases, and networking components, fully based in the cloud.</em></li>
</ul>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>On-Premises</summary>
  <p>Resources are deployed in on-premises data centers.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-cloud-computing">What are the benefits of cloud computing?<a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-cloud-computing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>

<details>
  <summary>Trade Upfront Expense for Variable Expense</summary>
  <ul>
<li>Upfront Expense: Traditional IT requires heavy initial investment in data centers, servers, and infrastructure before usage.</li>
<li>Variable Expense: Cloud computing allows businesses to pay only for the resources they consume, avoiding large capital expenditures.</li>
</ul>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Stop Spending Money on Data Center Maintenance</summary>
  <ul>
<li>Traditional Challenge: Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers.</li>
<li>Cloud Advantage: Cloud computing eliminates the burden of maintaining physical hardware, allowing businesses to focus on applications and customers.</li>
<li>Key Benefit: Is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.</li>
</ul>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Stop Guessing Capacity</summary>
  <ul>
<li>Traditional Challenge: You don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.</li>
<li>Cloud Advantage: Cloud providers offer auto-scaling features that adjust resources based on demand.</li>
</ul>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Benefit from massive economies of scale</summary>
  <p>By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Increase speed and agility</summary>
  <p>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Go global in minutes</summary>
  <p>The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency. This means that even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays.</p>

<li>Availability: The closest Region may lack certain features, as AWS expands services gradually by building hardware in each Region.</li>
<li>Pricing: Costs vary by Region due to local tax structures (e.g., running workloads in São Paulo may be 50% more expensive than in Oregon).</li>

<p>Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.</p>
<p>EBS is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.</p>
<p>When you create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p>Because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, it’s important to back up the data. You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.</p>

<details>
  <summary>What is a EBS snapshot?</summary>
  <p>An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. The first snapshot of an EBS volume copies all the data, while subsequent snapshots only save the blocks of data that have changed since the last snapshot. This approach differs from full backups, where all data is copied every time, including unchanged data. Incremental backups are more efficient, saving storage space and reducing backup time compared to full backups.</p>

<p>AWS Artifact(opens in a new tab) is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS Artifact consists of two main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS Artifact Agreements: In AWS Artifact Agreements, you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</li>
<li>AWS Artifact Reports: AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT -&gt; The customer compliance center?</strong></p>
<p>In the Customer Compliance Center, you can read customer compliance stories to discover how companies in regulated industries have solved various compliance, governance, and audit challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS answers to key compliance questions</li>
<li>An overview of AWS risk and compliance</li>
<li>An auditing security checklist</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="denial-of-service-attacks">Denial-of-Service Attacks<a href="#denial-of-service-attacks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users. Some of them are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm an application&rsquo;s capacity, making it unavailable. Since a single machine isn&rsquo;t powerful enough, attackers distribute the attack across multiple compromised machines (bots), unknowingly used to flood the target&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A UDP flood attack exploits internet services like the National Weather Service, which provide large responses to small requests. The attacker sends a simple request (e.g., &ldquo;Give me weather&rdquo;) but spoofs the return address to the victim’s server. As a result, the service floods the victim with massive amounts of data, overwhelming its capacity. This is just one of many brute-force attacks designed to exhaust a network’s resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP-level attacks mimic legitimate user behavior, such as repeatedly performing complex product searches. These attacks come from a network of compromised bots, overwhelming the server with excessive requests. As a result, real customers are unable to access the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Slowloris attack exploits server connection limits by making slow, incomplete requests, forcing the server to keep connections open indefinitely. This is like someone taking excessively long to order at a coffee shop, blocking others from being served. A few attackers can exhaust server resources, severely impacting availability.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>AWS Shield is a service that protects applications against DDoS attacks. AWS Shield provides two levels of protection: Standard and Advanced.</p>
