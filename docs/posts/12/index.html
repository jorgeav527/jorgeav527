<ul>
<li><strong>On-Demand Instances</strong> are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. There are two available types of Reserved Instances:
<ul>
<li>Standard Reserved Instances: This option is a good fit if you know the EC2 instance type and size you need for your steady-state applications and in which AWS Region you plan to run them.</li>
<li>Convertible Reserved Instances:  If you need to run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types, then Convertible Reserved Instances might be right for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>EC2 Instance Savings Plans</strong> reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and Region for a 1-year or 3-year term. This term commitment results in savings of up to 72 percent compared to On-Demand rates.</li>
<li><strong>Spot Instances</strong> are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="amazon-ec2-auto-scaling">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling<a href="#amazon-ec2-auto-scaling" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand.</li>
<li>Predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minimum capacity</strong> is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group.</li>
<li>The <strong>desired capacity</strong> at two Amazon EC2 instances even though your application needs a minimum of a single Amazon EC2 instance to run.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum capacity</strong> you might configure the Auto Scaling group to scale out in response to increased demand, but only to a maximum of four Amazon EC2 instances.</li>

<h2 id="aws-global-infrastructure">AWS Global Infrastructure<a href="#aws-global-infrastructure" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT -&gt; How to select the right AWS region?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Compliance: If your company requires data to stay within a specific country, choose a Region that meets those requirements (e.g., London for UK data residency).</li>
<li>Proximity: Running infrastructure close to customers improves content delivery (e.g., a Washington, DC company might use the Singapore Region for customers there).</li>
<li>Availability: The closest Region may lack certain features, as AWS expands services gradually by building hardware in each Region.</li>
<li>Pricing: Costs vary by Region due to local tax structures (e.g., running workloads in São Paulo may be 50% more expensive than in Oregon).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="storage-and-databases">STORAGE AND DATABASES<a href="#storage-and-databases" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT -&gt; What is a instance store?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT -&gt; What is a object storage?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file. Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on. An object’s key is its unique identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)<a href="#amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.</p>
<p>EBS is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.</p>
<p>When you create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p>Because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, it’s important to back up the data. You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="ebs-snapshot">EBS snapshot<a href="#ebs-snapshot" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. The first snapshot of an EBS volume copies all the data, while subsequent snapshots only save the blocks of data that have changed since the last snapshot. This approach differs from full backups, where all data is copied every time, including unchanged data. Incremental backups are more efficient, saving storage space and reducing backup time compared to full backups.</p>
<h2 id="s3-bucket">S3 Bucket<a href="#s3-bucket" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object-level storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. It supports uploading any file type (e.g., images, videos, documents) and is commonly used for backups, media storage, and archiving. Amazon S3 provides unlimited storage space, with a maximum object size of 5 TB. Users can set permissions to control access and visibility of files and enable versioning to track changes to objects over time.</p>
<p>There are two questions you have to answer about what kind of data you want to store in S3:</p>
<ol>
<li>How often you plan to retrieve data from S3?</li>
<li>How available you need your data to be in S3?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s3-standard">S3 Standard<a href="#s3-standard" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns</li>
<li>Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven’t accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, S3 Standard-IA. If you access an object in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier, S3 Standard.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-nonrelational-databases">Amazon Nonrelational databases<a href="#amazon-nonrelational-databases" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data. One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs. With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values). You can think of attributes as being different features of your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="denial-of-service-attacks">Denial-of-Service Attacks<a href="#denial-of-service-attacks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users. Some of them are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm an application&rsquo;s capacity, making it unavailable. Since a single machine isn&rsquo;t powerful enough, attackers distribute the attack across multiple compromised machines (bots), unknowingly used to flood the target&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A UDP flood attack exploits internet services like the National Weather Service, which provide large responses to small requests. The attacker sends a simple request (e.g., &ldquo;Give me weather&rdquo;) but spoofs the return address to the victim’s server. As a result, the service floods the victim with massive amounts of data, overwhelming its capacity. This is just one of many brute-force attacks designed to exhaust a network’s resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP-level attacks mimic legitimate user behavior, such as repeatedly performing complex product searches. These attacks come from a network of compromised bots, overwhelming the server with excessive requests. As a result, real customers are unable to access the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Slowloris attack exploits server connection limits by making slow, incomplete requests, forcing the server to keep connections open indefinitely. This is like someone taking excessively long to order at a coffee shop, blocking others from being served. A few attackers can exhaust server resources, severely impacting availability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
