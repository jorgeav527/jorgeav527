<h3 id="amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)<a href="#amazon-elastic-block-store-amazon-ebs" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.</p>
<p>EBS is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.</p>
<p>When you create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p>Because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, it’s important to back up the data. You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.</p>

<details>
  <summary>What is a EBS snapshot?</summary>
  <p>An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. The first snapshot of an EBS volume copies all the data, while subsequent snapshots only save the blocks of data that have changed since the last snapshot. This approach differs from full backups, where all data is copied every time, including unchanged data. Incremental backups are more efficient, saving storage space and reducing backup time compared to full backups.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-attacks">Types of attacks:<a href="#types-of-attacks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>

<details>
  <summary>What is a DDoS attack?</summary>
  <p>In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, multiple sources are used to start an attack that aims to make a website or application unavailable.</p>
<p>This can come from a group of attackers, or even a single attacker. The single attacker can use multiple infected computers (also known as “bots”) to send excessive traffic to a website or application.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Shield</strong>.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a UDP flood attack?</summary>
  <p>A UDP flood attack exploits internet services like the National Weather Service, which provide large responses to small requests.</p>
<p>The attacker sends a simple request (e.g., &ldquo;Give me weather&rdquo;) but spoofs the return address to the victim’s server. As a result, the service floods the victim with massive amounts of data, overwhelming its capacity.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Security Groups</strong> and <strong>AWS Shield</strong>.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is an HTTP-level attack?</summary>
  <p>HTTP-level attacks mimic legitimate user behavior, such as repeatedly performing complex product searches. These attacks come from a network of compromised bots, overwhelming the server with excessive requests.</p>
<p>As a result, real customers are unable to access the service.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS WAF</strong> to filter malicious traffic and rate-limit abusive requests.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a Slowloris attack?</summary>
  <p>The Slowloris attack exploits server connection limits by making slow, incomplete requests, forcing the server to keep connections open indefinitely.</p>
<p>This is like someone taking excessively long to order at a coffee shop, blocking others from being served. A few attackers can exhaust server resources, severely impacting availability.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</strong> to handle HTTP requests efficiently.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a SYN flood attack?</summary>
  <p>A SYN flood attack exploits the TCP handshake process by sending a large number of SYN requests without completing the connection.</p>
<p>The victim’s server keeps resources allocated for half-open connections, eventually exhausting its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of SYN flood attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Shield Advanced</strong> and <strong>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</strong> to detect and mitigate abnormal connection attempts.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a DNS amplification attack?</summary>
  <p>A DNS amplification attack abuses open DNS resolvers by sending small queries with a spoofed source IP (the victim&rsquo;s IP). These queries trigger much larger responses, which flood the victim with data.</p>
<p>This attack amplifies the attacker&rsquo;s bandwidth, making it highly efficient and destructive.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DNS amplification attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Route 53</strong> with <strong>AWS Shield Advanced</strong> to filter out malicious DNS traffic.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is an ICMP flood attack?</summary>
  <p>An ICMP flood (ping flood) attack overwhelms a network by sending excessive ICMP (ping) requests. This consumes both bandwidth and processing power, leading to service disruption.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of ICMP flood attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Security Groups</strong> and <strong>Network ACLs</strong> to block unnecessary ICMP traffic.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a Smurf attack?</summary>
  <p>A Smurf attack abuses ICMP by sending spoofed requests to a network’s broadcast address. Every device on that network responds to the victim’s spoofed IP, causing a massive traffic overload.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of Smurf attacks on your applications, you can use <strong>AWS Security Groups</strong> and <strong>AWS WAF</strong> to filter malicious ICMP traffic.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Rehosting</summary>
  <p>Rehosting also known as “lift-and-shift” involves moving applications without changes.</p>
<p>In the scenario of a large legacy migration, in which the company is looking to implement its migration and scale quickly to meet a business case, the majority of applications are rehosted.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Replatforming</summary>
  <p>Replatforming, also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Refactoring</summary>
  <p>Refactoring (also known as re-architecting) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features. Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Repurchasing</summary>
  <p>Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.</p>
<p>For example, a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a customer relationship management (CRM) system to Salesforce.com.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Retaining</summary>
  <p>Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Retiring</summary>
  <p>Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.</p>
</details>

<h3 id="the-aws-well-architected-framework">The AWS Well-Architected Framework<a href="#the-aws-well-architected-framework" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Operational Excellence</summary>
  <p>Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.</p>
<p>Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Security</summary>
  <p>The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate security best practices when possible.</li>
<li>Apply security at all layers.</li>
<li>Protect data in transit and at rest.</li>
</ul>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Reliability</summary>
  <p>Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions</li>
<li>Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand</li>
<li>Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Performance</summary>
  <p>Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.</p>
<p>Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Cost Optimization</summary>
  <p>Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.</p>
<p>Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Cost Optimization</summary>
  <p>Sustainability is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.</p>
<p>To facilitate good design for sustainability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand your impact</li>
<li>Establish sustainability goals</li>
<li>Maximize utilization</li>
<li>Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings</li>
<li>Use managed services</li>
<li>Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advantages-of-cloud-computing">Advantages of cloud computing<a href="#advantages-of-cloud-computing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Operating in the AWS Cloud offers many benefits over computing in on-premises or hybrid environments.</p>
<p>In this section, you will learn about six advantages of cloud computing:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Trade upfront expenses for variable expenses</summary>
  <p>Upfront expenses include data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using computing resources.</p>
<p>Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Benefit from massive economies of scale</summary>
  <p>By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.</p>
<p>Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregates in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale. Economies of scale translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Stop guessing capacity and scale in or out</summary>
  <p>With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.</p>
<p>For example, you can launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances when needed and pay only for the compute time you use. Instead of paying for resources that are unused or dealing with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need, and scale in or out in response to demand.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Increase speed and agility</summary>
  <p>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.</p>
<p>This flexibility also provides your development teams with more time to experiment and innovate.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Stop spending money and maintaining infrastructure or data centers</summary>
  <p>Cloud computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers.</p>
<p>A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Go global in minutes</summary>
  <p>The AWS Cloud global footprint enables you to quickly deploy applications to customers around the world, while providing them with low latency.</p>
